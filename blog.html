        <h3>Math 480B Project: April 26, 2014</h3>

          <p>
            It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do as my project for my Sage class. I tossed around the idea of re-implementing the baseball elimination algorithm that I did last winter in CSE 417 and implementing Go Fish! in Python. I even thought of making a game, probably Tic-Tac-Toe, but a student from last year's version of Math 480 already did that project. I was looking at the CSE 331 site from 11wi and the homework that caught my eye was the class schedule homework. So, I have decided that I will make a class scheduler GUI where the user can add/delete classes as well as save the schedule.

        <h3>Moving this site to Github: April 22, 2014</h3>

          <p>
            I have just moved this website from my Dante account on students.washington.edu to my Github user page. It works splendidly and I
            will be using this since my Dante account will expire soon after I graduate. It took about an hour or two for Github to finally load
            my website.
          </p>

          <p>
            A new goal I have is to re-learn regular expressions and get better at them. Also, I want to get better at using the terminal, so I will be
            learning from <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390a/14wi/">CSE 390A</a> from Winter 2014. CSE 390A is the System and Software Tools class.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently testing out <a href="http://elementaryos.org/">Elementary OS</a>. So far it works great! It looks like Mac OS X, but it is really
            sleek and easy to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have always wanted to have a <a href="links.html">links</a> page and I have finally added it to my website!
          </p>

        <h3>Goals that I have: April 20, 2014</h3>

          <p>
            One of the biggest goals I have is to become a better programmer. In order to do this, I plan to work on the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/11sp/">CSE 331</a>: Software Design and Implementation assignments and use Github along with it to save my work. Doing this will help me get better at programming in Java and learn important programming concepts. So I will have to self-study the lectures and do everything basically on my own. Another goal is for me to keep updating this blog and discuss things that I have learned, whether it be from my Sage class or from doing these assignments.

        <h3>Math 480B: April 13, 2014</h3>

          <p>
            I am finally writing my first blog post. This quarter is my last as an undergraduate at the University of Washington and I want to
            finish my undergraduate career on a good note.
          </p>

          <p>
            I only need one more math class to fulfill my degree and I found the perfect class that was being offered in Spring 2014. I also wanted to learn more about Python. I am currently taking Math 480B, which is using Sage, an open source mathematical software using Python. Many people say it's a great class and I hope to learn a lot from the class. I am learning a lot in that class. List comphrension is pretty cool and it's filling in the gaps about Python that I haven't learned before.
          </p>

          <p>Example of list comphrension:</p>
          
          <p><code>my_data = [n**Integer(2) for n in range(Integer(10))]</code></p>

          <p>
            The cool thing about list comprehensions is that it is concise and easy to understand and instead of writing out a loop, everything
            can be written in just one line.
          </p>

          <p>
            As for Sage, I am liking it so far. It is much better than using MATLAB. Also, Professor Stein creating the 
            <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a> website is a great idea. Sure, it has some bugs (like 
            refreshing the browser causes it to go back to the login screen), but not needing to install anything and programming on a web
            browser is great.
