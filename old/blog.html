        <h3>Static vs non-static methods: May 30, 2014</h3>

        <p>
          I never truly understood the differences between static and non-static methods. When thinking of non-static methods, I thought about how
          I created objects in CSE 143 and basically none of the classes I wrote dealt with static methods as opposed to in CSE 142 where basically all of the methods were static. While working on the course scheduler project and reading Core Java, I have begun to understand what it means to be static.
        </p>

        <p>
          A static method belongs to a class itself while a non-static method belongs to an object. A great example of static methods is the use of the Math class in Java. When you want to use a method in the Math class, say pow, you do not need to initialize a Math object to perform the calculation. Static methods are methods that do not operate on objects.

        <h3>Update on project: May 27, 2014</h3>

        <p>
          I haven't updated this blog in a while, but I have been working on my project and have nearly completed it. It is due next Monday, June 2nd at 6 am. I first was implementing the Course Scheduler in Python (and I actually finished all of the back end programs), but was unfamiliar with Python GUI programming. So I decided to start over and make it using Java, especially since Java is designed for object oriented programming. So for the past couple of weeks, I have been re-implementing the classes in Java and have been testing and learning new things about Java. I finally ran the SchedulerMain program and the GUI showed up without errors! I have been able to successful add and remove courses as well as save the courses in a .txt file in an order chosen by the user. I just need to test it more and see if there are any bugs.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to talk about the things I learned while working on the project. I learned about Java comparators, which allows me to define a specific ordering of an object. I also learned about enumerators, which are objects with a fixed set of values and cloning an object, which makes a shallow copy of an object. While working on the project, I realized how long it has been since I last programmed in Java, but I remembered the syntax pretty easily. It seemed to come pretty natural. I also have been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-I-Fundamentals-9th-Sun/dp/0137081898/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">Core Java Volume 1 Fundamentals</a> to refresh myself on Java and learn Java and object oriented programming in more depth. It is a big book, but it is a book that I want to continue reading and just learning more and more about Java.

        <h3>Math 480B Project: April 26, 2014</h3>

          <p>
            It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do as my project for my Sage class. I tossed around the idea of re-implementing the baseball elimination algorithm that I did last winter in CSE 417 and implementing Go Fish! in Python. I even thought of making a game, probably Tic-Tac-Toe, but a student from last year's version of Math 480 already did that project. I was looking at the CSE 331 site from 11wi and the homework that caught my eye was the class schedule homework. So, I have decided that I will make a class scheduler GUI where the user can add/delete classes as well as save the schedule.

        <h3>Moving this site to Github: April 22, 2014</h3>

          <p>
            I have just moved this website from my Dante account on students.washington.edu to my Github user page. It works splendidly and I
            will be using this since my Dante account will expire soon after I graduate. It took about an hour or two for Github to finally load
            my website.
          </p>

          <p>
            A new goal I have is to re-learn regular expressions and get better at them. Also, I want to get better at using the terminal, so I will be
            learning from <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390a/14wi/">CSE 390A</a> from Winter 2014. CSE 390A is the System and Software Tools class.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently testing out <a href="http://elementaryos.org/">Elementary OS</a>. So far it works great! It looks like Mac OS X, but it is really
            sleek and easy to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have always wanted to have a <a href="links.html">links</a> page and I have finally added it to my website!
          </p>

        <h3>Goals that I have: April 20, 2014</h3>

          <p>
            One of the biggest goals I have is to become a better programmer. In order to do this, I plan to work on the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/11sp/">CSE 331</a>: Software Design and Implementation assignments and use Github along with it to save my work. Doing this will help me get better at programming in Java and learn important programming concepts. So I will have to self-study the lectures and do everything basically on my own. Another goal is for me to keep updating this blog and discuss things that I have learned, whether it be from my Sage class or from doing these assignments.

        <h3>Math 480B: April 13, 2014</h3>

          <p>
            I am finally writing my first blog post. This quarter is my last as an undergraduate at the University of Washington and I want to
            finish my undergraduate career on a good note.
          </p>

          <p>
            I only need one more math class to fulfill my degree and I found the perfect class that was being offered in Spring 2014. I also wanted to learn more about Python. I am currently taking Math 480B, which is using Sage, an open source mathematical software using Python. Many people say it's a great class and I hope to learn a lot from the class. I am learning a lot in that class. List comphrension is pretty cool and it's filling in the gaps about Python that I haven't learned before.
          </p>

          <p>Example of list comphrension:</p>
          
          <p><code>my_data = [n**Integer(2) for n in range(Integer(10))]</code></p>

          <p>
            The cool thing about list comprehensions is that it is concise and easy to understand and instead of writing out a loop, everything
            can be written in just one line.
          </p>

          <p>
            As for Sage, I am liking it so far. It is much better than using MATLAB. Also, Professor Stein creating the 
            <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a> website is a great idea. Sure, it has some bugs (like 
            refreshing the browser causes it to go back to the login screen), but not needing to install anything and programming on a web
            browser is great.
